# User Database Assignment

The goal was to create a basic application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that can perform the following operations:

=>  View List of all Users
=>  Add a User
=>  Edit & Update a User 
=>  Delete a User

The application form must has the following fields : name, email, date of birth, gender, hobby, country, state and city. The country, state and city input fields are dependent dropdown (i.e., state dropdown is populated based on country field value and city dropdown is populated based on state field value). The proper field validations are also done to ensure format and length validity.

# Once the form is validated and submitted, an entry gets created in the user table
